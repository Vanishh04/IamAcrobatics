Firstly, you came to gym and learning individual elements and make condition exercices to improve you muscle forces, then you begin work in pair or in a groop. By the way, in acrobatics there are a places for everyone, and it's not depends tall or short your height parameters,

        <p class="about-acrobatics-section-p about-section-p fz18 fw400 pb20">There are many parts of competition, which we talk about. Let's talk about competition exercise. It is contains of three major exercices: Balance routine, Dynamic routine and Combine routine. Every exercise have a some distinctions. Balance routine require an elements which athletes execite in static positions at feet to feet, feet to hand, hand to hand, head to hand and more varieties of that. There are two kinds of balance elements: mounts and static motions. Dynamic has the distinguishing feature. Base/es need to push their top to the height, during things top makes turns around and make specific elements, like salto (means frontflip or backflip), in different positions (like at group or like pike) or upright (planche), or the above elements with rotation from 180 degrees and more. Combine routine includes some elements from balance and some from dynamic. By the way, there are some proportion of element's amount, for example 3:5, 5:3, 4:4. There a some formula, which means that if you had a points value for dynamic - X points, a maximum balance points of value, which you can obtain will be - 2X. About difficulty points we will talk about later.</p>

        <h2 class="about-acrobatics-section-h2 about-section-h2 fz26 fw500 pt20">About evaluation on competitions and more</h2>
        <p class="about-acrobatics-section-p about-section-p fz18 fw400 pb20">Let's introduse about criteria of evaluation the acrobatic perfomance during competition. The criteria contains of three main things like Execution, Artistry, Difficulty. <br><br>

          Firstly, the coefficient of execution is responsibility of purity of elements, and a correctness of them. There are some file, which has the information about how many points will lose athlete,if they make some mistake. Also athletes can lose some points of execution, if someone of their pair / group will bend arm, feet or elbow. Quantity countdown points of execution starts from 10. During the routine, depends of mistakes, it's decreases, and after end of a routine, it will be multiplies at x2. So if athletes receive a 9.2 points of execution, at report will be 18.400. We will talk about all execution details later. <br><br>
          
          Secondly, will talk about artistry. This part has a specific criteria of evaluation. In fact, pair / group of athletes already receive a 5 points, when they step up on the perfomance floor. Next 5 points are split for 5 criteria, which contains of topics like partnership, perfomance, expression, creativity, musicality. Every of this had 3 or more sub-topics, includes question, for example: "Do all partners project the emotion of exercise?", and a variable, if is true - 0.4, if it's middle - 0.2, if it's false - 0. It was little bit example. Based on criteria build all grade for artisrty. We will talk about later more. <br><br>
          
          Thirdly, next part will be topic about difficulty. Difficulty is a parameter, which is responsible for complication of each element during routine. Every element and some forms of it has the definite points value cost. So that means, if athletes do their routine, for example, balance routine - it they complete all off their 8 elements (at balance you have to do 5 - 8 elements, and on the dynamic and combine 6 elements), they will be receive 240 points of difficulty. Then after routine, points of difficulty divide by 100, then athletes will receive Difficulty coefficient: 2.40, which will add up to final grade.</p>

                The coefficient of difficulty is a parameter, which is responsible for complication of each element during routine. Every element and some forms of it has the definite points value cost. So that means, if athletes do their routine, for example, balance routine - it they complete all off their 8 elements (at balance you have to do 5 - 8 elements, and on the dynamic and combine 6 elements), they will be receive 240 points of difficulty. Then after routine, points of difficulty divide by 100, then athletes will receive Difficulty coefficient: 2.40, which will add up to final grade.

            <p class="about-acrobatics-section-p about-section-p fz18 fw400 pb20">Now we will talk about the age groups, which are present in FIG - calendar championships, like Internationals European / Asian / Pan - American Age Group Competitions, Junior European / Asian / Pan - American Championship, Senior European / Asian / Pan - American Championship, International World Age Group competition, Junior World Championship, Senior World Championship and more. There are 4 main age groups at this events: 11 - 16 , 12 - 18, 13 - 19 and Senior. Numbers mean the ranges of age athletes, which entitles them to take a part of competition at this age group. Senior is available if all athletes from pair or group has the 15+ age. Main differnces of this age - groups is a difficulty and couple another things. <br><br>

              Firstly, at 11 - 16 you need to make 4 compulsory elements from specific table of elements for 11 - 16 AG, and make 2 elements for pair / group choice. At this AG, athletes make only Balance and Dynamice routine. <br><br>
              
              Secondly, at 12 - 18 you need to make 70 points of difficulty at Dynamic, 80 points of difficulty at Balance, and 100 points of difficulty at Combine. Triple salto is fordidden at this age group. Allowable treshold for Balance, Dynamice and Combine is 100, 90, 120 respectively. But, at order will be going 70, 80 and 100. If it will be much more than threshold - there will a penalty for 1.0 point. Concerned the penalties, if height difference of athletes in pair / group will more then 35+ , the penalty will 0.5, if height parameter in the interval from 30 to 34.99, penalty will be 0.3.
            </p>
            <p class="about-acrobatics-section-p about-section-p fz18 fw400 pb20">
              Thirdly, at 13 - 19 you need to complete 110 points of difficulty at Dynamic, 120 points of difficulty at Balance, and 180 points of difficulty at Combine. Triple salto is not prohibited. Allowable treshold for Balance, Dynamice and Combine is 130, 140, 200 respectively. But, at order will be going 110, 120, 180. If it will be much more than threshold - there will a penalty for 1.0 point. Concerned the penalties, if height difference of athletes in pair / group will more then 35+ , the penalty will 1.0, if height parameter in the interval from 30 to 34.99, penalty will be 0.5.

            <p class="about-acrobatics-section-p about-section-p fz18 fw400 pb20">
              Fourthly, at Senior category you can make unlimited points of difficulty in all routines. All the elements from difficulty table are available. Concerned the penalties, if height difference of athletes in pair / group will more then 35+ , the penalty will 1.0, if height parameter in the interval from 30 to 34.99, penalty will be 0.5.

          The information and a compilation of specific rules were taken from the official FIG website, in the section with files and updates that are regularly published. On this account dedicated to sports acrobatics, posts will be published that narrate about things that are present in the life of every acrobat. This includes various world-level competitions that are arranged according to the FIG sports event calendar, and other details related to equipment and processes without which the conduct of competitions would be impossible. The theme of today's post will be about what would lack systematization and precision in acrobatics, and there would be no unified standard. This is height and its measurement. Measuring height is an integral part of competitions. Regardless of the level of the competitions, whether they are local, national, or even more so, world-level – this procedure must be present. In events and competitions organized by FIG or IOC (if it concerns the World Games) and EOC (if in turn it concerns the European Games), height measurement is specified as mandatory in the competition regulations. The following information was taken and paraphrased from the document 'Acrobatic Gymnastics Code of Points 2022 - 2024,' issued by FIG, and serves as an addition to the main rules and is dedicated precisely to height and its measurement
